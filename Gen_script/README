Note: The Redmond2K theme generator script is not complete but it is functional, this is mostly for demo until the script is finished.
For now you can use the config file to choose your colors. When the theme is installed it will save your config file in the installed
theme folder for later reference.

To use the script:
-Edit theme.conf to set the desired colors and multipliers. 6 digit and 3 digit hex codes must be used.
-Run ./gen_theme.sh to compile and install the theme.

Files are installed in ~/.themes/
