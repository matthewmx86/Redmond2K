## About
The Redmond2K project aims to recreate the Win2K look and feel for the XFCE4 desktop environment. 
The goal is to provide the clean and professional look of the classic Windows desktop while enjoying 
the stability and flexability of Linux. A side effect of the theme is that programs running under wine
also integrate nicely with the Redmond2K theme. The theme should be useful for those who are new to Linux
and would prefer a familiar interface or those feeling a little nostalgic for the classic look.

## Extras
Included with the main theme package are the GTK themes, the Xfce4WM theme, and a Firefox classic IE5 theme.
A theme generator script is also available to compile the Redmond2K theme using custom colors.
